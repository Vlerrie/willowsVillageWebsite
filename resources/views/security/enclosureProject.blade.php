        <p class="col-lg-10 fs-4">An expert consultant with a considerable amount of experience in the field of community enclosures has been contacted, we have received his opinions and a general cost breakdown.
            We are excited to say that it is indeed possible to start enclosures of our community, but it will be a long and costly project.
            This is why we need an absolute unified front and total support of the community to drive this project to completion.
            The initial enclosure will consist of 4 gates and 2 permanent* road blocks (see visual below / to right).</p>
