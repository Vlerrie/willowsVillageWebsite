    Smart Camera Project
</h1>

<p class="fs-4">
    Following the recent increase in crime in Die Wilgers, a task team was assembled to investigate possible efforts aimed at making our streets safer again. One important part of the fight against crime involves cameras and how to actively and intelligently apply the footage obtained from them to discourage, prevent and react to crime. A lot of planning and proposed approaches have been discussed. This communication aims to inform the broader Wilgers community about the proposed plan of action, and to invite participation and, extremely importantly, support and buy-in from as many residents as possible.
    Comsafe is currently installing cameras at four important entry points to Die Wilgers, namely:
</p>
<ul class="fs-4">
    <li>Corner of Karwats and Rossouw</li>
    <li>Corner of Uitspan and Rossouw</li>
    <li>Corner of Power and Farm</li>
    <li>Verkenner Road (Willowridge High School)</li>
</ul>

<p class="fs-4">
    These cameras are being connected to Comsafe’s control room which boasts impressive vehicle number plate and facial recognition capabilities and a searchable database keeping track of all recorded activities. The intelligence built into this system, which allows the effective monitoring of, and focussed response to, hundreds of cameras, is extremely important for making this a tool to prevent and react to crime rather than just being able to see what happened after it’s too late to do anything about it.
    As soon as the cameras have been installed and connected, Comsafe will start building up a database of vehicles, people and activities to start calibrating and populating the system. In the near future, a meeting will be scheduled to demonstrate the capabilities of the system to residents.
    The idea is that more and more cameras should be added to this system over time so that, eventually, most of, if not all of the Die Wilgers area can be monitored. Comsafe is willing to carry the initial cost of piloting the system, but they need a critical mass of cameras and support from residents to allow this to be successful in the long term.
    The residents of Power Avenue have taken the lead in working with Comsafe to determine how cameras can also be deployed to cover Power Avenue as a start, and the willingness of residents to become involved and support the initiative will determine the speed with which this project can be successfully rolled out to more streets. This is a project that becomes more powerful the more we can work together in the wider Die Wilgers area, so a combined approach is crucial.
